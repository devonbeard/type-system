Type System is a general-purpose design system and stylesheet for beautiful, readable typesetting on the web.
Following tried-and-true typographic principles and inspired by Robert Bringhurst,
Type Systems offers smart defaults for consistently balanced hierarchy and effortless visual rhythm.


## Type Scale

1. 72px
2. 48px
3. 36px
4. 24px
5. 18px
6. 12px

## Measure

Using 32em as the max-width ensures line lengths never exceed roughly 66 characters, staying within the widely-regarded range of 45 â€“ 75 characters.

## Space Scale

Margins are derived from the core type scale and always align to an 8px baseline grid.

1. 8px
2. 16px
3. 32px
4. 64px
5. 128px
6. 256px
